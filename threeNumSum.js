// The function should find the all triplest in the array that sum up tp the target sum
//and return two dimensional array of all triplets. The numbers in the each triblet should ne in ascending order
//and triblets also should be ordered in ascending order
// {"array": [12, 3, 1, 2, -6, 5, -8, 6], "targetSum": 0}
// answer =  [[-8, 2, 6], [-8, 3, 5], [-6, 1, 5]]
